Quick Start Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import graphem as ge
   import networkx as nx

   # Generate a scale-free network
   edges = ge.generate_ba(n=1000, m=3)
   
   # Create and run embedding
   embedder = ge.GraphEmbedder(
       edges=edges,
       n_vertices=1000,
       n_components=3
   )
   embedder.run_layout(num_iterations=50)
   
   # Find influential nodes
   seeds = ge.graphem_seed_selection(embedder, k=20)
   
   # Estimate influence spread
   G = nx.Graph(edges)
   influence, _ = ge.ndlib_estimated_influence(G, seeds, p=0.1)
   print(f"Influence spread: {influence} nodes ({influence/1000:.1%})")
   
   # Visualize results
   embedder.display_layout()

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install GraphEm using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install graphem-jax

For GPU/TPU support, see the `JAX installation guide <https://github.com/google/jax#installation>`_.

Core Components
---------------

GraphEmbedder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main embedding engine that combines spectral initialization with iterative force-directed refinement:

* **Spectral Initialization**: Uses graph Laplacian eigenvectors for initial positioning
* **Force-Directed Layout**: Applies spring forces between connected nodes and repulsion between all nodes
* **Intersection Avoidance**: Prevents node overlap for cleaner visualizations
* **Adaptive Parameters**: Automatically adjusts forces based on graph structure

HPIndex
~~~~~~~

High performance index for efficient k-nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional embeddings:

* **Memory Efficient**: Memory tiling for large point sets
* **Batch Processing**: Vectorized nearest neighbor queries

Influence Maximization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Advanced algorithms for identifying influential nodes in networks:

* **GraphEm Method**: Uses embedding radial distances to select diverse, influential seeds
* **Greedy Baseline**: Traditional greedy algorithm for comparison
* **Spread Simulation**: NDlib integration for accurate influence estimation

Graph Generators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comprehensive collection of standard and custom graph models:

.. code-block:: python

   # Classic models
   edges = ge.erdos_renyi_graph(n=500, p=0.02)
   edges = ge.generate_ba(n=500, m=3)  # Scale-free
   edges = ge.generate_ws(n=500, k=6, p=0.1)  # Small-world
   
   # Community structures
   edges = ge.generate_sbm(sizes=[100, 150, 100], p_in=0.1, p_out=0.01)
   edges = ge.generate_caveman(clique_size=10, num_cliques=5)
   
   # Specialized networks
   edges = ge.generate_geometric(n=300, radius=0.2)
   edges = ge.generate_road_network(grid_size=20, connection_prob=0.8)

Performance Characteristics
---------------------------

GraphEm is designed for high performance across different scales:

**Small Networks (< 1K nodes)**
   * Real-time embedding and visualization
   * Interactive parameter tuning
   * Comprehensive analysis possible

**Medium Networks (1K - 10K nodes)**
   * Efficient embedding with optimized parameters
   * Batch processing for multiple analyses
   * GPU acceleration recommended

**Large Networks (10K+ nodes)**
   * Memory-efficient algorithms
   * Progressive refinement strategies
   * Distributed processing capabilities

Benchmarking Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GraphEm shows promising performance:

* **Speed**: Much faster than the greedy algorithm for node influence maximization
* **Memory**: Memory tiling for efficiency, can process large datasets
* **Accuracy**: Strong correlation with ground-truth centrality measures
